Fix holes and customize the map (Updated to The Criminal Enterprises DLC)
The purpose of this script is to fix the holes in the map by loading zones that aren’t loaded by default. I’ve added quite a lot of places to load, based on Mikeeh’s script. If you just want to fix the holes in the map, then use this resource as provided.

This resource has been completely rewritten from scratch since v2.0. You can customize almost every storymode and online purchasable interiors from your own resources.
